# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Website project! This README file will guide you through the setup and development process.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a personal portfolio website to showcase the projects I've built during my studies. The portfolio website consists of:

- **Main Page:** Featuring different projects I've built.
- **Contact Page:** Contains my contact information for potential outreach.
- **Project Details:** Additional information for each project, detailing the technology used.

## Project Objectives

- Build a website using HTML and CSS.
- Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript.
- Utilize Git for version control and tracking changes.
- Work with the command line and file navigation.
- Develop locally on my computer.
- Deploy the site to the web using GitHub Pages.

## Development

During development, I followed these guidelines:

- Structured the website with HTML, focusing on semantic markup.
- Styled the website using CSS to ensure a visually appealing design.
- Added interactive features using JavaScript to enhance user experience.
- Regularly committed changes using Git for version control.

## Deployment

Once the website was ready, I deployed it to the web using GitHub Pages:

1. **Push Code to GitHub:**
   - Ensure that the final version of your code is committed and pushed to a GitHub repository.

2. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Select the branch you want to deploy from (typically `main` or `master`).
   - Click "Save."

3. **Access Your Live Site:**
   - GitHub Pages will provide a URL where your site is hosted. Access your live site through this URL.

Feel free to explore and customize the website as needed. Happy coding!
